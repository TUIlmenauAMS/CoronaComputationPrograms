# Corona Computation Programs
Programs and Jupyter Notebooks for Corona computations.

coronaconcucrrentlysick.py and coronaconcucrrentlysick.ipynb compute and compare the number of Corona concurrently sick people for a group of coutries, which can be set in the program, over time since the beginning of March, or another starting point which can also be set in the program. It then also computes the density of concorrently sick and the death cases, per million inhabitants. If you let the Juypter notebook version run in Colab, it recomputes the plots up to the newest date, and, if changed, for new countries. 

Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab:

This lets you run the program to update the plots and to change the countries. If you add a new country, also look up its population in millions, e.g. in Wikipedia, and enter it (also works on a smartphone).
