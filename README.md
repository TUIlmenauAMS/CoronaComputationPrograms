# Corona Computation Programs
Programs and Jupyter Notebooks for Corona computations

Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab:
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TUIlmenauAMS/CoronaComputationPrograms/blob/master/coronaconcucrrentlysick.ipynb)

This lets you run the program to update the plots and to change the countries. If you add a new country, also look up its population in millions, e.g. in Wikipedia.
